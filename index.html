                <a href="#q1"><span class="number">1</span> it too dangerous for teens?</a>
            </p>
            <article id="q1">
                There are age limits that suit each expedition. We ensure that our itinerary is safe and away from any possible dangers.
                Teens, however, are required to act on their own behalf with responsibility in following closely with the experts' instructions.

                <a href="#q2"><span class="number">2</span>What can teens benefit from this?</a>
            </p>
            <article id="q2">
                Here at Observanture, we believe that lifelong learners don't remain confined to ordinary classroom environments.
                By working within the field, teens will see both how the professional and natural world works together in their learning journey.

                <a href="#q3"><span class="number">3</span>Can parents come along?</a>
            </p>
            <article id="q3">
                Parents can come along on their own independent travels. However, teens are recommended to learn how to work on their own to
                get as much experience. No provisions such as protective clothing and equipment would be provided to parents who come along.
